                        <h2>A Risk of Heart Disease Due to Personal and Family 
						History</h2>
                        <p>Rachel was in her forties&nbsp;and had rheumatoid arthritis 
						(RA). She occasionally saw a&nbsp;rheumatologist in New York 
						City for management of her RA and rarely saw her primary 
						care physician. In fact, she&nbsp;had only seen her 
						physicians twice in the last five years.</p>
						<p>Rachel was keeping busy with work and her kids and&nbsp;was 
						generally feeling well when she felt a twinge in her 
						chest. She chalked it up to stress, noting that the 
						sensation of pressure&nbsp;in her chest came and went for the 
						next two weeks. It often was accompanied by some stomach 
						upset. She took some over the counter heartburn 
						medication but had no relief.</p>
						<p>At&nbsp;her son's soccer game the next&nbsp;weekend Rachel began 
						to&nbsp;feel dizzy and the pressure in her chest suddenly 
						increased. Aware now that her symptoms matched what she 
						had read about for heart attacks, she immediately asked 
						her husband to get the team doctor. The doctor confirmed 
						that her symptoms could be the result of a heart attack, 
						gave Rachel an aspirin and called for an ambulance. 
						Rachel&nbsp;was&nbsp;evaluated in the emergency department of a local 
						hospital and found to have a blockage in one of her main 
						coronary arteries.&nbsp;She underwent surgery to place a&nbsp;stent 
						in the artery to hold it open, staying 2 days in the 
						hospital.</p>
						<p>Rachel had not thought she was at increased risk for a 
						heart attack. The last time her primary care doctor 
						asked about her family history she had confirmed that 
						she did not have any close relatives with a history of 
						heart disease. She hadn't thought to mention the two 
						cousins who had heart attacks in their 40s, thinking 
						they were too distantly related to be important. Recent 
						studies have shown that two distant relatives with heart 
						disease on the same side of the family can increase risk 
						to the same degree as having a single close relative 
						with heart disease - Rachel's family history meant that her 
						risk for heart attack was&nbsp;3 times&nbsp;as high the general 
						population risk.</p>
						<p>Further,&nbsp;Rachel's personal history of RA impacted her 
						risk of heart disease: It was only recently discovered 
						that patients with poorly controlled RA have a 
						significant risk for heart disease regardless of 
						cholesterol levels. Inflammation plays a large role in 
						sudden heart attacks and the warning signs were 
						definitely there for Rachel.</p>
						<p>Rachel was lucky that she was able to get to a hospital 
						quickly. Had she understood her risk for a heart attack, 
						she would have pursued increased screening and made sure 
						her RA was as well controlled as possible. She would 
						also have known not to ignore her symptoms.<br>
