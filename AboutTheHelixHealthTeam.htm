                        <font color="#000000">
						<p><strong>Steven A.R. Murphy, MD </strong>is a 
						physician, educator and entrepreneur, influential in 
						diverse fields from education and health care to 
						software development and the blogosphere. Dr Murphy 
						received two undergraduate degrees from the Pennsylvania 
						State University where he studied genetics and religion. 
						He went on to receive a medical degree from the New York 
						Medical College, pursuing externships in medical 
						genetics at Yale University, Albert Einstein College of 
						Medicine, and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine during 
						his medical school training. Dr. Murphy completed an 
						internship in pediatrics and medical genetics at the 
						Mount Sinai School of Medicine and continued his 
						training in Internal Medicine at Yale New Haven Health&#8217;s 
						Greenwich Hospital. Currently his efforts are directed 
						towards shaping personalized medicine through Helix 
						Health. Dr. Murphy is extending his training as the 
						genetics fellow at Yale University until 2010. His plans 
						include the creation of a training program in Internal 
						Medicine and Genetics at Yale University School of 
						Medicine. Currently he serves on the faculty at New York 
						Medical College as an Instructor in the Department of 
						Cell Biology and Anatomy. Dr. Murphy is a prominent 
						blogger in the field of personalized medicine and 
						genomics and is a consultant to several venture capital 
						firms. </p>
						<p>The creative vision of Helix Health has evolved since 
						2004 when Dr. Murphy conceived of a genetic testing and 
						consulting, database, and educational organization that 
						will help usher in a new era of personalized medicine. 
						He has dedicated himself to establishing the referral 
						base for Helix Health, educating colleagues regarding 
						current genetic technology, and charting the direction 
						of the company. Dr. Murphy is a member of the American 
						Society of Human Genetics, the American Academy of 
						Pediatrics, and the American College of Physicians and 
						is a charter member of the Physician Genome 
						Partnership-an organization is dedicated to guiding best 
						clinical practices in genomics. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>Adam J. Messenger, MD </strong>received his 
						medical degree from New York Medical College where he 
						concomitantly completed his Master of Science degree in 
						Pharmacology. He received his Bachelor of Science degree 
						in Neuroscience from Trinity College in Hartford, CT 
						after serving as a cadet at the United States Coast 
						Guard Academy. Dr. Messenger completed his residency 
						training in Internal Medicine at Yale New Haven Health&#8217;s 
						Greenwich Hospital where he served as Chief Resident. 
						During his residency he continued to actively study and 
						apply the principles of Pharmacology. Dr. Messenger 
						recently was appointed to the faculty at New York 
						Medical College and at the Graduate School of Basic 
						Medical Sciences in the Department of Pharmacology. </p>
						<p>Dr. Messenger has a particular interest in the fields 
						of Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacogenetics, which strive 
						to select the correct medication and the correct dosage 
						of that medication based on an individual&#8217;s genetic 
						blueprint. He and Dr. Murphy met in medical school and 
						share the vision of personalized medicine provided by 
						Helix Health. They continue to lecture extensively about 
						personalized medicine and genetic health topics 
						throughout the tri-state area. &nbsp;</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>Matthew B. Lubin, MD</strong> is a clinician, 
						researcher, inventor and educator. Dr. Lubin&#8217;s interest 
						in genetics reaches back to the beginnings of the 
						recombinant DNA revolution, when he obtained bachelors 
						degrees in both biochemistry and biology at Brandeis 
						University. After earning his medical degree at New 
						Jersey Medical School and training in internal medicine 
						at University Hospital in Newark, Dr. Lubin completed a 
						three-year fellowship in medical genetics at UCLA and 
						Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. There his 
						special interest was the genetics of common adult 
						diseases. He helped establish the Cedars-Sinai GenRISK 
						program, one of the first programs in the nation to help 
						patients with family histories of disorders such as 
						heart disease and breast cancer. Returning to the New 
						York metropolitan area, Dr. Lubin continued his career 
						as the Director of Medical Genetics at the Preventive 
						Medicine Institute/Strang Cancer Prevention Center in 
						Manhattan. Evaluating literally hundreds of patients 
						with familial breast cancer at Strang, Dr. Lubin&#8217;s 
						clinical research helped identify BRCA1, the gene which, 
						when mutated, is most commonly responsible for 
						hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. In the laboratory 
						Dr. Lubin was part of a team that developed and 
						eventually earned a patent for new DNA detection 
						techniques. Since leaving Strang, Dr. Lubin has been on 
						the staff of Lenox Hill Hospital while seeing patients 
						in a private medical genetics practice devoted to common 
						adult disorders.<br>
						&nbsp;<br>
						Dr. Lubin is proud and excited to join the team at Helix 
						Health, whose vision for preventive care guided by 
						family history and genetic information so closely agrees 
						with the philosophy that he has held for so long.<br>
						&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>Jennifer Ibrahim, MD</strong> is a Clinical 
						Geneticist who received her MD degree at UMDNJ-New 
						Jersey Medical School. She completed her pediatric 
						residency at Babies Hospital, Columbia College of 
						Physicians and Surgeons in New York and fellowship 
						training in clinical genetics in the Department of Human 
						Genetics of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. She 
						currently serves as a&nbsp;clinician at St. Joseph&#8217;s Regional 
						Medical Center&nbsp;Section of Genetics in addition to 
						working with the Helix Health team.&nbsp;She is a Diplomat of 
						the American Board of Pediatrics and the American Board 
						of Medical Genetics. Her specialty interests 
						include&nbsp;preconception&nbsp;genetics as well as familial 
						cancer syndromes. </p>
