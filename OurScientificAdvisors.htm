						<p><strong>Brynn Levy, M.Sc.(Med), Ph.D. </strong>is 
						internationally recognized as a pioneer and expert in 
						the field of cytogenetics, and specifically in the area 
						of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). He received 
						two undergraduate degrees (genetics and biochemistry, 
						medical and human genetics) and a master of science in 
						medicine degree (genetic counseling, medical and human 
						genetics) from the University of the Witwatersrand in 
						Johannesburg, South Africa. Continuing his post-graduate 
						education, Dr. Brynn then received a master of 
						philosophy degree in biomedical sciences and his PhD in 
						cytogenetics and molecular cytogenetics at the Mount 
						Sinai School of Medicine in New York.&nbsp; After 
						holding several genetic counseling positions during his 
						undergraduate and masters training years, Dr. Brynn then 
						assumed leadership roles at the Mount Sinai School of 
						Medicine, including Director of the Molecular 
						Cytogenetics Laboratory and Associate Director of the 
						Clinical Research Division of the Department of 
						Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences. In 
						2005 he moved to Columbia University Medical Center to 
						assume the roles of Director of Clinical Cytogenetics 
						and Associate Professor of Clinical Pathology.&nbsp; <br>
						&nbsp;<br>
						Dr. Brynn is particularly interested in the use of CGH 
						technology in the fields of reproductive medicine and 
						cancer and has authored many peer-reviewed articles and 
						book chapters on these topics. As this technology is 
						poised to revolutionize many areas of clinical genetics, 
						Dr. Brynn is routinely invited to share his experience, 
						expertise, and vision for the future at both national 
						and international meetings. He is licensed in both New 
						York and New Jersey as a state Clinical Cytogenetics 
						Director and is board certified in Genetic Counseling 
						and Clinical Cytogenetics. He is affiliated with 
						Affymetrix and is currently serving as the Chair of the 
						company&#8217;s Scientific Advisory Committee for Clinical 
						Diagnostics. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>Eric Johnson, Ph.D., </strong>until quite recently, split his time 
						between research and clinical efforts, serving as both 
						the Director of the Neurovascular/Epilepsy Genetics 
						Research Laboratory at the Barrow Neurological Institute 
						(BNI) in Phoenix Arizona and as Founding Director of the 
						clinical Molecular Diagnostics and BioBanking 
						Laboratories at PreventionGenetics in Marshfield, 
						Wisconsin.&nbsp; Since January of 2008 he has devoted 
						his efforts fully to his new Clinical venture, ACireGeneTics, a laboratory dedicate to affordably 
						serving the clinical and research needs of the rare 
						disease community.</p>
						<p>Born and raised in New England, he graduated from 
						Boston University with honors and worked on platelet 
						physiology at Harvard Medical School, going on to do 
						graduate work in Neuropharmacology and Neuroscience at 
						the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.&nbsp; 
						Eric did post-doctorate work in Psychiatry and 
						Neurosurgery at Yale University in New Haven, 
						Connecticut before receiving advanced training in 
						Genetics at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. 
						He established the Neurogenetics Research Lab at the 
						Center for Medical Genetics in Wisconsin before being 
						recruited to develop the Neurovascular/Epilepsy Genetics 
						lab at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, 
						Arizona in 1998.&nbsp; He returned to Wisconsin in late 
						2003 to help Dr. Jim Weber found PreventionGenetics, a 
						new Diagnostics and BioBanking company.</p>
						<p>Dr. Johnson has a long history in BioBanking, helping 
						to establish and run the DNA banks for his own 
						neurovascular anomaly and epilepsy research efforts as 
						well as for PXE, International, the ARPKD/CHF Alliance, 
						the CFC Family Network and most recently, as Founding 
						Director of the Genetic Alliance (GA) BioBank, for the 
						Joubert Syndrome Foundation, the Noonan Syndrome Support 
						Group, the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research 
						Foundation, the National Psoriasis Foundation and the 
						Angioma Alliance.&nbsp; The Genetic Alliance BioBank is 
						a DNA/Tissue archiving facility that will serve the 
						nearly 600 patient advocacy and support groups, 
						representing thousands of patients who are affected by 
						hundreds of rare and potentially devastating heritable 
						diseases that make up the GA.</p>
						<p>Dr. Johnson is currently a member of the American 
						Epilepsy Society, The Society for Neuroscience and has 
						served on both the Social Issues and Consumer Issues sub 
						committees for the American Society for Human Genetics.&nbsp; 
						Dr. Johnson lectures frequently both in the US and 
						Internationally on BioBanking and the ethical 
						implications of genetics research.&nbsp; He is the 
						author of numerous manuscripts relating to neuroscience 
						and genetics and the co discoverer of the nature, 
						identity and function of several epilepsy and 
						neurovascular related genes including FEB2, a febrile 
						seizure susceptibility gene and CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 
						three causative genes for cerebral cavernous 
						malformations. He is considered an expert in 
						translational research:&nbsp; moving genetic tests for 
						rare diseases from the lab bench to the clinic. </p>
