						<h2>Genetic Testing Based on Ethnic Background</h2>
                        <p>When Lucy and Tom were ready to start a family they 
						talked to Lucy's doctor about their plans.&nbsp;Was there 
						anything they&nbsp;could do&nbsp;to maximize the chance of a 
						successful pregnancy and a healthy baby?&nbsp;The 
						doctor&nbsp;asked questions about their personal and family 
						histories and then raised the option of genetic testing 
						to see&nbsp;if they were carriers for an inherited condition 
						known as cystic fibrosis (CF). She explained that this 
						condition was more common in people with European 
						ancestry, like Lucy and Tom, and that it was still relevant 
						for them despite the fact that neither of them had a 
						family history of CF. Lucy and Tom had a lot of questions 
						and the doctor suggested that they talk with a genetic 
						counselor prior to making their decision about carrier 
						testing.</p>
						<p>During genetic counseling Lucy and Tom learned about the 
						symptoms of CF, how it is inherited, and about the 
						information that genetic carrier testing could give 
						them. They understood that&nbsp;their chances of having a 
						child with CF would be&nbsp;as high as 1 in 4 if they were 
						both carriers, or much lower than that if neither, or 
						only one of them was a carrier. They agreed that they 
						were interested in understanding their chances of having 
						a child with CF, even though they were not sure about 
						whether they would want to manage a future pregnancy any 
						differently based on the results.</p>
						<p>Lucy pursued CF carrier testing first and her results 
						showed that she had inherited the most common CF gene 
						mutation.&nbsp;Tom pursued testing next and the couple was 
						relieved to learn that&nbsp;the results were negative: 
						Tom&nbsp;was 
						not a CF carrier.&nbsp;This meant that their chances of 
						having a child with CF was only about 1 in 800.&nbsp;Both 
						felt that the counseling and testing process had been 
						useful in allowing them to make the most informed choice 
						possible before planning their pregnancy.<br>
